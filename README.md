 # Demographic Changes in Santa Barbara County


Examining the changes in ethnic composition in Santa Barbara County compared to 29 other California counties.


### Introduction:

Population data was sourced from the American Community Survey (ACS), which consists of of survey data from 30 California counties. 

#### Figure 1:  List and map of the counties sampled represented in the ACS datasets. 

The dataset comprises a total of 499,974 individuals across both 2011 and 2021 who selected their ethnicity as one of the following: Not Hispanic, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, or Other Hispanic. Please note that the Cuban data for Madera County in 2011 and Imperial County in 2021 were not reported in the ACS and were thus omitted from the analysis.


## Analysis 

#### Tables 1 & 2


Santa Barbara County’s ethnic composition differs slightly from the aggregate proportion of all 30 counties, with a higher proportion of hispanics all together, and a higher proportion of people who identify as Mexican. Within Santa Barbara County, the Non-Hispanic population has remained mostly constant. The proportion of Mexican individuals has decreased and the proportion of other hispanic individuals has increased by roughly the same amount.

This suggests that Santa Barbara County may be undergoing a unique demographic shift, possibly driven by local factors. Additionally, it is possible that the roughly 2 percent of persons who identified as Mexican in 2011 identified as “other hispanic” in 2021. Further research is needed to explore the specific reasons behind these changes and their implications for the county’s social and economic landscape.

Understanding these trends can inform policies and initiatives aimed at addressing the evolving needs of Santa Barbara’s diverse population.
